### *Applied Mathematics and Statistics*
# Linear Regression

- In this project, we will understand how to build a model to predict the average lifespan using linear regression
  - #### Requirement 1a: Use all 10 features provided
    - Train only once for 10 features on the entire training set *train.csv*
    - Show formula for regression model (calculate according to 10 features in )
    - Report 1 result on the test set *test.csv* for the newly trained model
    
  - #### Requirement 1b: Build a model using only 1 feature, find a model for the best result
    - Test on all **10** features the topic provides
    - Requires using *5-fold Cross Validation* method to find the best feature
    - Report 10 corresponding results for 10 models from *5-fold Cross Validation* (calculate the average)
    - Show the formula for the regression model according to the best feature (calculated y on the feature best show found)
    - Report 1 result on the test set *test.csv* for the best model found
    
  - #### Requirement 1c: Students build their own models, find the model that gives the best results
    - Build m different models (minimum 3), and at the same time different models at 1a and 1b
    - Ask to use *5-fold Cross Validation method* to find the best model
    - Report **m** corresponding results for **m** models from *5-fold Cross Validation* (calculate the average)
    - Show the formula for the best regression model found by students
    - Report 1 result on the test set *test.csv* for the best model found

- File **Report.pdf** will detail the methods of the Linear Regression.
